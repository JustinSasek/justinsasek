# About Me:
Hi, I'm a researcher in the Robot Perception and Learning (RPL) Lab under Dr. Yuke Zhu, where I focus on general-purpose robotics. I am driven by a long-term vision of achieving embodied AGI, believing that robots have unparalleled potential to positively impact the world. My primary research interest is in adapting video data to scale robot learning.<br><br>Currently, I’m a student in the Computer Science and Business Honors Program at UT Austin, which provides me with a unique interdisciplinary perspective to my research. As a fast learner, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge.
